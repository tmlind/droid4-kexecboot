Install of LineageOS to droid 4 stock partition using droid4-kexecboot

With droid4-kexecboot it is possible to boot Android images and Linux
distros on raw partitions without using loopback devices unlike earlier
SafeStrap based installs. This also means that there is no longer a need
to necessarily keep the old stock Android image on the device.

We still use SafeStrap files as the Android recovery, but load it with
droid4-kexecboot from mmcblk1p22 preinstall partition. These instructions
assume install to raw partitions on the eMMC and micro-SD card.

As of lineage-14.1-20181212-nightly-maserati-signed.zip version, it can
now be installed to the mmcblk1p20 stock partition on droid 4 emmc while
optionally reformatting mmcblk1p25 emstorage as ext4. These instructions
assume lineage-14.1-20181212-nightly-maserati-signed.zip or a later image.

From: https://download.lineageos.org/extras

Optionally you may also want to get the current open_gapps pico zip file
if you need gapps.

2. Current limitations and things to consider for partitioning

To avoid having to reconfigure your device multiple times, you may want
to first consider how to use the partitions on eMMC cand how to partition
your mico-SD card. The mmcblk1 eMMC partitions are quite crazy, so please
read file PARTITIONS carefully before install.

3. Install droid4-kexecboot to the device

To install, use fastboot to unlock the utags and bpsw partition. Then flash
current droid4-kexecboot image and utags to boot to it:

$ fastboot flash mbm allow-mbmloader-flashing-mbm.bin
$ fastboot reboot bootloader
$ fastboot flash bpsw current/droid4-kexecboot.img
$ fastboot flash utags utags-mmcblk1p13.bin

And then you may want to lock the utags and bpsw partitions later on after
things are working again with:

$ fastboot flash mbm mbm.bin

You can get the mbm.bin from the droid 4 stock kernel firmware. And you should
have droid 4 updated to VRZ_XT894_9.8.2O-72_VZW-18-8_CFC version first.

And then you have to configure kexecboot as described below.

If you at some point want to uninstall droid4-kexecboot, it can be done with:

$ fastboot flash mbm allow-mbmloader-flashing-mbm.bin
$ fastboot reboot bootloader
$ fastboot erase utags
$ fastboot flash mbm mbm.bin

4. Install SafeStrap recovery

Start with installing SafeStrap recovery to a micro-SD card that we can
then copy to the eMMC to the mmcblk1p22 preinstall partition. The recovery
is needed for installing components with adb sideload, such as addonsu and
gapps if needed. It is also needed to install LineageOS updates later on.
After the SafeStrap recovery is installed to mmcblk1p22 preinstall partition,
it's not necessary to keep it on the micro-SD card necessarily.

Note that we cannot use the Motorola recovery because it does not support
the LineageOS keys, and cannot be modified to add keys. And it does not
support the newer key format. And as the Motorola recovery is signed, we
cannot install anything to that partition without cause in issues where
the Motorola bootloader will only boot to fastboot mode.

4.1 Extract SafeStrap files to the micro-SD card

On your PC, Extract SafeStrap and install it to the micro-sd card into
any partition for kexecboot to find it:

$ sudo mkfs.ext4 -O^metadata_csum,^64bit /dev/microsd-partition
$ sudo mount /dev/mcirosd-partition /mnt
$ sudo tar zxf Safestrap-maserati-v3.75-altpart.tar.gz -C /mnt
$ sudo umount /mnt

4.2 Boot to SafeStrap recovery with kexecboot

Install the micro-SD card into the device and boot it up. You should see
kexecboot menu with option "SafeStrap recovery". Select it with the up and
down arrow keys and press enter to boot to recovery. After few seconds,
SafeStrap recovery menu shows up on the device.

4.3 Copy SafeStrap recovery from micro-SD card to eMMC

With device running in SafeStrap recovery, connect USB cable, and copy the
recovery files from the micro-SD card to the mmcblk1p22 preinstall partition
if not already done. Note that the following will wipe your mmcblk1p22
preinstall partition, and if your're already using it for something other
than the stock Android preinstall, make a back-up first. Assuming you're
OK to wipe mmcblk1p22 preinstall partition, on your PC do:

$ adb shell
# mke2fs -T ext4 /dev/block/mmcblk1p22
# mkdir /preinstall
# mount /dev/block/mmcblk1p22 /preinstall
# mkdir /microsd
# mount /dev/block/mmcblk0p1 /microsd
# cp -r /microsd/boot /preinstall/
# umount /microsd
# umount /preinstall

4.4 Back-up the stock kernel WLAN modules for kexecboot

With device running in SafeStrap recovery, back up the stock kernel WLAN
modules to the mmcblk1p22 preinstall partition if not already done:

$ adb shell
# mkdir /preinstall
# mount /dev/block/mmcblk1p22 /preinstall
# mount /dev/block/mmcblk1p20 /system
# mkdir -p /preinstall/lib/modules/3.0.8-stock
# cp /system/lib/modules/* /preinstall/lib/modules/3.0.8-stock/
# umount /system
# umount /preinstall

5. Install LineageOS

With device running SafeStrap recovery, you can now start LineageOS
install.

5.1 Make sure mmcblk1p24 data partition is formatted

If you have updated the system to the original distro but never booted
it, it seems that the mmcblk1p24 userdata partition needs to be formatted
for LineageOS to start. Note that if you've used your device before,
there's no need for this. Also note that the following will wipe your
userdata on the device:

# mke2fs -T ext4 /dev/block/mmcblk1p24

5.2 Optionally reformat mmcblk1p25 emstorage partition as ext4

Based on your needs as described in the PARTITIONS file, optionally
reformat mmcblk1p25 emstorage partition as ext4. This currently cannot
be done if using mmcblk1p23 webtop for LineageOS, and mmcblk1p25 emstorage
must be formatted vfat for that. For LineageOS on mmcblk1p23 webtop
partition, skip to 5.3.

$ adb shell
# mke2fs -T ext4 /dev/block/mmcblk1p25

There is no need to use any special ext4 flags above as the SafeStrap
recovery is using the stock v3.0.8 kernel that does not understand the
newer flags.

note: if you came from LOS14 using Stock partition (mmcblk1p20) then you need to reformat mmcblk1p25 to vfat
how to do it, its little bit tricky

first back to firmware folder (VRZ_XT894_9.8.2O-72_VZW-18-8_CFC.xml.zip)
then flash emstorage to the device, because mke2fs cannot format partition to vfat.

type:

host@user# fastboot flash emstorage emstorage.img

now there's a problem, if you see on safestrap recovery, the Internal storage free Space is just 25Mb

to get back the rest, you cannot just format using safestrap recovery, it will cause the internal a.k.a (/sdcard on safestrap recovery)
not mount.

to format it. go to Mount menu on safestrap, then Mount USB Storage
on your host machien you will se new partition 25mb free of 8gb.
just format it using file manager. to fat32 and it will be back 8gb free.

5.3 Configure mmcblk1p25 emstorage partition active_slot file

The mmcblk1p25 emstorage needs to be configured for LineageOS to use the
right boot partition no matter if it's vfat or ext4 formatted:

$ adb shell
# mount /dev/block/mmcblk1p25 /ss
# mkdir /ss/safestrap
# echo stock > /ss/safestrap/active_slot

Note that "stock" must be used above for active_slot for both mmcblk1p20
system partition without gapps and for mmcblk1p23 webtop partition. Do
not use "altpart" name above for active_slot, it will cause a blank screen
on boot.

5.4 Set the stock partition active in SafeStrap recovery

On the device, select "Boot Options" -> "Stock ROM" -> "Activate" if not
already active. After setting it, red "ROM SLot: stock" should display on
the top of the screen

if you gona install to webtop partition, select "Boot Options" -> "Webtop -> System" -> "Activate"
then you see on the top left corner ROM Slot: altpart

5.5 Install LineageOS with adb sideload

On the device, select "Advanced" -> "ADB Sideload", check both options
to wipe caches, then swipe to start sideload

On PC, start adb sideload with the latest LineageOS 14.1 image:

$ adb sideload lineage-14.1-20181212-nightly-maserati-signed.zip

This will take several minutes. Then you may also want to install su while
at it after restarting sideload also on the device first:

$ adb sideload addonsu-14.1-arm-signed.zip

5.6 Configure kexecboot boot/boot.cfg file on the stock partition

Note that you currently need to do this every time you update LineageOS
on the mmcblk1p20 stock partition.

$ adb shell
# mount /system
# mkdir /system/boot
# cat > /system/boot/boot.cfg << EOF
LABEL=LineageOS on mmcblk1p20 stock partition
PRIORITY=8
DTB=/etc/kexec/devtree
KERNEL=/etc/kexec/kernel
INITRD=/etc/kexec/ramdisk.img
CMDLINE="androidboot.safestrap.romslot=stock"
TIMEOUT=3
EOF

Or if booting to mmcblk1p23 webtop altpart:

$ adb shell
# mkdir pre
# mount /dev/block/mmcblk1p23 /pre
# cat > /pre/boot/boot.cfg << EOF
LABEL=LineageOS on mmcblk1p23 webtop partition
PRIORITY=7
DTB=/etc/kexec/devtree
KERNEL=/etc/kexec/kernel
INITRD=/etc/kexec/ramdisk.img
CMDLINE="androidboot.safestrap.romslot=altpart"
TIMEOUT=3
EOF

5.7 Install optional gapps

You can install gapps pico zip file simlar to the addonsu file in 5.6 above.
If installing gapps to mmcblk1p23 webtop partition after booting it,
you need to do a "factory reset" on the device in SafeStrap under Wipe.

5.8 Done, reboot the device

The first time LineageOS starts, it will take several minutes to boot.

Additional Note: If you try install LOS14 Using webtop partition, and get black screen after chosee on kexecboot.
go to safestrap recovery again check if your webtop partition (mmmcblk1p23 is ext3 partition type. and the mmcblk1p25 is vfat)
you can check by type "blkid"

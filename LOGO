oke here im just want to share about bootlogo/splashscreen
when the device is booting.

instead of motorola logo im replace it with maemo-leste logo

im suggest it to execute using fastboot from your host machine,

so type this

# fastboot flash logo.bin logo.bin
# fastboot reboot

and see the different.

if you not gona make your own logo, i have allready logo.bin
with maemo-leste logo, here:
#https://github.com/xsetiadi/droid4-kexecboot/blob/master/logo.bin

and if you want to create with another picture
here the guide

instructions are essentially the same for gimp and photoshop:

create a 540x540 image
merge into one layer

Gimp: select Colors > Components > Channel Mixer

Photoshop: select Image > Adjustments > Channel Mixer

select Output channel:
- Red and change the red value from 100 to 0 and the blue value from 0 to 100
now select Output channel:
- Blue and change the red value from 0 to 100 and the blue value from 100 to 0

hit OK

Note: the colors will look strange but will display properly on the phone

Gimp: select file > export
name "logo.bin"
select "all files" from dropdown menu
expand the "select file type (by extension)" menu and select "raw image data"
export

Photoshop: select file > save as
name "logo.bin"
format "photoshop raw"
save


Thanks to p3droid and TBH!
